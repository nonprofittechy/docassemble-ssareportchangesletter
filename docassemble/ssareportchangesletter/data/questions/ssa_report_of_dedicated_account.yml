  Rep Payee's Report of Dedicated Account
decoration: table
subquestion: |
  This interview helps you fill out a Report of Benefits
  and Dedicated Account. You can use this to complete the information
  that would be in the printed form Social Security may have already
  sent you. That form looks like this:

  [CENTER]
  [FILE form_preview.png]
  
  We will ask questions about you and your spending over
  the last year, and information about the person who is
  getting Social Security Benefits.

  You only need to report information about money you spent
  or added to a "dedicated spending account".
  
  You will need to have the form that Social Security sent
  you to fill out, and receipts and bank statements
  from the last year.

  Review your dedicated account entries

  So far, it looks like you deposited ${currency(dedicated_account_deposits.total())}
  since your last report to SSA and withdrew ${currency(dedicated_account.total())},
  which means the current balance should be **${currency(Decimal(report_dedicated_account_total_balance) + Decimal(dedicated_account_deposits.total()) - Decimal(dedicated_account.total()) )}**

  If that doesn't look right, make any changes needed below.
