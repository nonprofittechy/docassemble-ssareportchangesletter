field: intro_screen
question: |
  We're here to help.
subquestion: |
  This is a tool for people on SSI or SSDI disability benefits. It will help you write
  a letter to the Social Security Administration (Social Security) to tell them about 
  [important changes](https://blog.ssa.gov/reporting-changes-is-your-responsibility/) 
  in your life they need to know about.

  [SSI Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-rights-responsibilities.htm)

  You must report any of the changes listed [here](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-report-ussi.htm) no later than 10 days after the end of the month in which the change occured. 
  Before you start, you need to know if you are on
  
  * SSI (Supplemental Security Income), 
  * SSDI (Social Security Disability) or
  * SSI and SSDI.
  
  If you are working and getting paid, you also need:
  the name and address of the place you work, 
  the number of hours you work, and
  how much you are paid.
  Your pay stubs should have all this information on them, so having them with you 
  from the start will be helpful.
  If you are answering questions  for someone else, you need their:
  full name, 
  address, and 
  Social Security number.
